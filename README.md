# Customer-Retention-Analysis-and-Subscription-Optimization
Analyze customer retention and subscription data using advanced SQL techniques to identify patterns, evaluate churn risks, and optimize strategies for increasing customer retention. It involves building SQL queries for segmenting users, calculating retention and churn metrics, cohort analysis, and predicting high-risk customers.


# Customer Retention Analysis and Subscription Optimization

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer retention for a subscription-based service using advanced SQL queries. The analysis identifies trends, retention metrics, churn risks, and calculates Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to make data-driven decisions for improving customer loyalty.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains sample subscription data.
- `sql/`: SQL scripts for data cleaning, cohort analysis, retention metrics, churn prediction, and CLV calculation.
- `notebooks/`: Notebooks with exploratory analysis and visualizations.

## Key Metrics Calculated
- **Retention Rate**: Percentage of customers who remain active.
- **Churn Rate**: Percentage of customers who cancel their subscriptions.
- **Cohort Analysis**: Tracks retention over time by customer cohort.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Estimates the lifetime revenue from each customer segment.

## Getting Started
1. **Set Up Database**: Import the `subscription_data.csv` file into your SQL database.
2. **Run SQL Scripts**: Execute each script in the `sql/` folder sequentially.
3. **Analyze Results**: Use the outputs to identify retention trends and optimize subscription offerings.

## Sample SQL Queries
